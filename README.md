## User-Centric Design
To model our data structure effectively, we've created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). This visual representation maps out the relationships between various entities in our system, such as users, child profiles, vaccines, and medications. The ERD serves as a blueprint for our database design, ensuring that data is organized and structured efficiently.

## Features

### Track Vaccines for Your Child

Our application serves as a comprehensive guide to your child's immunization journey. Keep all your child's vaccine information in one place and have it at your fingertips, anytime, anywhere.

### Know Administered Vaccines

Say goodbye to sifting through papers and health records. Our app keeps a log of all vaccines your child has received. It gives you detailed information, including the type of vaccine and the date it was administered. This way, you are always aware of your child's immunization status and can easily provide records to healthcare providers or educational institutions.

### Upcoming Vaccines

Planning is key to ensuring your child gets all the required vaccines on time. Our application provides you with a list of upcoming vaccines, complete with due dates and information about each vaccine. With these reminders, you can easily schedule appointments with healthcare providers well in advance.

### Peace of Mind

The uncertainty and complexity of managing your child's vaccination schedule can be stressful. Our app alleviates that stress and ensures you are well-informed, helping you make better healthcare decisions for your child.

## Project Approach

### The Challenge of New Parenthood

Becoming a parent is a monumental milestone filled with joy, love, and, naturally, challenges. One such challenge that new parents often face is navigating through the complex and sometimes overwhelming world of childhood vaccinations. As a parent of a newborn, I found myself jumping through hoops, scouring numerous resources, and dealing with a maze of healthcare guidelines to get accurate and timely information about vaccinations. While these initial years should be spent enjoying the miraculous journey of your child's growth, parents often find themselves bogged down by the intricacies of vaccine schedules, dosages, and medical jargon.

### The Inspiration

That's when it hit meâ€”why not build something for future parents that would make those first years easier to enjoy? I wanted to create a tool that alleviates this stress, so parents can focus on what really matters: raising a happy, healthy child.

### The Solution: A One-Stop App for Child Immunization

And so, this app was bornâ€”crafted with the utmost care and diligence to serve as a one-stop solution for all your childâ€™s vaccination needs. With features that allow you to track administered vaccines, set overdue alerts, and even get a heads-up on upcoming vaccinations, the app aims to empower parents to take control of their child's health in a simplified and user-friendly way.

### Empowering Parents

Through this app, I hope to bring peace of mind to you as a parent, because when you're informed and prepared, you can make better healthcare decisions for your child. With all the information and reminders at your fingertips, you can reclaim those joyful moments that might otherwise be lost to worry and uncertainty.

### The Reward

The true reward for this project lies in the knowledge that it may help parents breathe a little easier and enjoy the priceless first years of their childâ€™s life a bit more fully. After all, informed parenting is empowered parenting, and thatâ€™s a gift that keeps on giving.

## Hurdles Encountered During Development

**Angular Connection to the Back End**
One of the significant challenges was establishing a secure and reliable connection between the Angular frontend and the Spring Boot backend. This was the first time I was linking a frontend to a backend, so it required a solid understanding of RESTful APIs.

**Solution:** I followed Angular's [HttpClient module documentation](https://angular.io/guide/http) and made use of the RxJS library to make HTTP requests to the backend endpoints. Additionally, I ensured that proper CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration was in place on the backend to allow the frontend to communicate with it.

---

**Receiving or Sending Data in the Wrong Format**
Working with data between the frontend and backend required careful attention to data formats. Sometimes, data sent or received was not in the expected format, leading to issues in rendering or processing the information.

**Solution:** To address this challenge, I meticulously reviewed the data structures and models on both the frontend and backend. I used TypeScript interfaces to define the expected data structures and made sure that data was serialized and deserialized correctly when sending and receiving requests.

---

**CSS Issues**
Styling and CSS compatibility can be challenging, especially when aiming for a responsive design. Inconsistencies in layout and appearance across different devices and browsers needed to be resolved.

**Solution:** I leveraged [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), a front-end framework, to ensure a responsive and consistent design. I also used CSS media queries to fine-tune the styling for various screen sizes. Cross-browser testing was conducted to identify and fix any compatibility issues.

---

**Learning Angular as a New User**
As a new user of Angular, the learning curve was steep. Understanding the framework's concepts, components, and services took time, and I had to overcome the initial hurdles of setting up the Angular development environment.

**Solution:** I invested time in learning Angular through online tutorials, documentation, and hands-on practice. I followed best practices for project structure and modularization, which improved code organization and maintainability. I also sought assistance from online communities and mentors when faced with specific challenges.

---

**Long Nights and Persistence**
The challenges mentioned above, combined with project deadlines, resulted in many long nights and persistence. It was essential to stay motivated and focused during challenging moments.

**Solution:** I maintained a positive attitude and stayed committed to the project's goals. I broke down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps, making it easier to tackle challenges one at a time. Collaboration with team members also provided valuable support and insights during challenging periods.

In conclusion, overcoming these challenges in connecting Angular to the backend, handling data formats, addressing CSS issues, and learning Angular as a new user required a combination of technical knowledge, persistence, and collaboration. These experiences contributed to a valuable learning journey and the successful development of the BabyInsight Baby Health Tracker frontend.
